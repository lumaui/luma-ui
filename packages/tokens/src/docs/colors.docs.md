# Colors

## Purpose

The color system provides a carefully curated palette that embodies Neo-Minimal principles: slightly desaturated colors, comfortable for extended viewing, with progressive contrast that never shouts.

All colors use the OKLCH color space for perceptual uniformity, ensuring consistent lightness perception across different hues.
